list = [22,27,16,2,18,6]

1.	insertion sort steps:
		n: [22,27,16,2,18,6]
		n-1: [2,27,16,22,18,6]
		n-2: [2,6,16,22,18,27]
		n-3: [2,6,16,18,22,27]
2.	O(n^2)
3.	best case: n
	average case: n^2
	worst case: n^2
4.	average case

	  n: [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]
	n-1: [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
	n-2: [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
	n-3: [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
	n-4: [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
